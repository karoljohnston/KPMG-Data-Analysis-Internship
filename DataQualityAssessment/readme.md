Task 1
Data Quality Assessment
Assessment of data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis

Task:
- Review the data quality to ensure that it is ready for our analysis in phase two.
- Draft an email to the client identifying the data quality issues and strategies to mitigate these issues.


Assessing the data:
  - Transaction table: 
          - There are 360 blank columns on online_order. Orders were not specified if it was purchased online or in store
          - Brands: 197 blanks
          - Product_line: 197 blanks
          - Product_class: 197 blanks
          - Product_size: 197 blanks
          - Standard_cost: 197 blanks
          - Product_first_sold: 197 blanks
      In my conclusion, I believe that the blank fields are connected as there are 5 column with the same amount of blanks. I will investigate tomorrow.
