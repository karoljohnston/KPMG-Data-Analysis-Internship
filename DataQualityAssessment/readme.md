Assessing the data:<br>
  - Transaction sheet: <br>
          - There are 360 blank columns on online_order. Orders were not specified if it was purchased online or in store<br>
          - Brands: 197 blanks<br>
          - Product_line: 197 blanks<br>
          - Product_class: 197 blanks<br>
          - Product_size: 197 blanks<br>
          - Standard_cost: 197 blanks<br>
          - Product_first_sold: 197 blanks<br>
      In my conclusion, I believe that the blank fields are connected as there are 5 column with the same amount of blanks. I will investigate tomorrow.<br>
 - NewCustomerList sheet: <br>
          - There are 29 last names were not listed<br>
          - Gender: should be labeled properly insstead of just labeling it as 'u'<br>
          - 17 customers did not put their birthdates <br>
          - 106 customers did not specify their job title <br>
          - There are no deceased customers - therefore, that column is not relevant <br>
          - All customers are from Australia - there is no point of having a 'country' column<br>
